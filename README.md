SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate
=================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codeclimate/SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codeclimate/SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter][docs] provides an interface to [codeclimate](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate). Code Climate supports a variety of languages through standardized Docker images known as static analysis engines.

## Installation
SublimeLinter 4 must be installed in order to use this plugin. If SublimeLinter 4 is not installed, please follow the instructions [here][installation].

### Linter installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `codeclimate` is installed on your system. Please see the `codeclimate` documentation, specifically [Prerequisites](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate#prerequisites) and [Installation](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate#installation)

### Linter configuration
In order for `codeclimate` to be executed by SublimeLinter, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter. Before going any further, please read and follow the steps in ["Finding a linter executable"](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable) through "Validating your PATH" in the documentation.

Once you have installed and configured `codeclimate`, you can proceed to install the SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate plugin if it is not yet installed.

### Plugin installation
Please use [Package Control][pc] to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette][cmd] and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

When the plugin list appears, type `codeclimate`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

## How it works
If the first opened folder in SublimeText contains a `.codeclimate.yml` configuration file in its root, `codeclimate` will recognize this file's settings.

Suppose the `codeclimate` CLI finds no configuration file in the folder root: In that case, it will automatically run the default inspections of `structure` and `duplication`. If you have a `.codeclimate.yml` configuration file in a different folder, you can set SublimeLinter's `working_dir` setting (please see examples).

## Settings
For general information on how SublimeLinter works with settings, please see [Settings][settings]. For information on generic linter settings, please see [Linter Settings][linter-settings].

### Examples
You can set the path to the `codeclimate` executable in the global SublimeLinter settings or your project settings:

```json
{
  "linters": {
    "codeclimate": {
      "executable": "/usr/local/bin/codeclimate"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to ignore the configuration of a `.codeclimate.yml`,  for instance, to run a subset of codeclimate engines, you can set linter arguments in the global SublimeLinter settings or your project settings:

```json
{
  "linters": {
    "codeclimate": {
      "args": [
          "-e",
          "structure",
          "-e",
          "duplication"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Suppose you use a `.codeclimate.yml`-configuration file. In that case, the `codeclimate` CLI needs to be executed in your configuration file's directory. Otherwise, it can't detect your configuration and runs only the default analyzes.

SublimeLinter takes the (first) open folder (or the folder of a single opened file) as the working directory for executing its linter commands. You can change this behavior by setting the working directory of execution:

```json
{
  "linters": {
    "codeclimate": {
      "working_dir": "/path/to/working/dir"
    }
  }
}
```

*Hint: Make sure the working directory is in the path of the file you want to lint!*

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1. Fork the plugin repository.
2. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.
3. Commit and push the topic branch.
4. Make a pull request.
5. Be patient.

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

- Indent is 4 spaces.
- Code should pass flake8 and pep257 linters.
- Vertical whitespace helps readability, don’t be afraid to use it.
- Please use descriptive variable names, no abbreviations unless they are very well known.
